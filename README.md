- 👋 Hi, I’m William. Thanks for stopping by!
- 👀 I'm a technical writer and technologist, and I'm most interested in working with cloud-native, open-source projects that help organizations orchestrate applications and microservices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and working on a Linux certification.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on documentation and potentially coding as I become more familiar with projects.
- 📫 You can find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/woodardwrites/.
